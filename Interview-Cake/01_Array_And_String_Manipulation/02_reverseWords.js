/**
 * Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. 
 * The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.
 * Write a function reverse_words() that takes a message as a list of characters and reverses the order of the words in place.
 * Example:
 const msg =   [ 'c', 'a', 'k', 'e', ' ',
 'p', 'o', 'u', 'n', 'd', ' ',
 's', 't', 'e', 'a', 'l' ];
 
 reverseWords(msg);
 
 console.log(message.join(''));
 * When writing your function, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, and all words are separated by one space.
