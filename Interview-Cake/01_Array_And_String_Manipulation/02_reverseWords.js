/**
 * Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. 
 * The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.
 * Write a function reverse_words() that takes a message as a list of characters and reverses the order of the words in place.
 * When writing your function, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, and all words are separated by one space.
