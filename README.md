# Personal Algorithm Practice Repo
###### Using Cracking the Coding Interview, Leetcode, and More

### Goals
* Practice algorithms every day *(current streak: 0)*
* Learn more about data structures
* Improve analysis of complexities (both time and space)
* Understand what goes on behind the scenes (ex. what algorithm the Array sort method uses)
* Have fun and exercise the brain

### Structure
My code will be structured in the following order
1. Instructions - The problem the algorithm is supposed to solve
2. Solutions (sometimes one, other times more alternatives I experimented with)
3. console.log's of potential inputs, to check my work, with the correct solution commented right underneath
4. My pseudocode, since I write most of my algorithms on paper before typing it up and checking it
