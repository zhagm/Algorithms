ELEMENTARY SORTING ALGORITHMS (OR QUADRATIC - bc their complexities are all O(n^2))

Space complexity is O(1) for all of them.

Time complexities:
BUBBLE SORT:
    Best: O(n)
    Worst: O(n^2)
    Average: O(n^2)

SELECTION SORT:
    Best: O(n^2)
    Worst: O(n^2)
    Average: O(n^2)

INSERTION SORT:
    Best: O(n)
    Worst: O(n^2)
    Average: O(n^2)
